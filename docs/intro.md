# Getting started

FreeGPT.js is a free ChatGPT library made on open-source. Let's know it a bit.

## How is it free?

It is actually a reverse-engineer of a leaked GPT...but just for educational purposes :P

## Can I use it?

Yes, this is why it is called **Free**GPT.js, we made it free for everyone.

## Is it safe for commerical use?

I do not gurantee, but this is only for educational purposses and non-commerical use. For commerical use, please check [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com) or other AI safety companies.

> **Is it stable?**
> To me, it is currently working. However, I listened from one my European friend that it appears like the API is blocked there. I'm not sure, please report us so we can know if its blocked for you too.
