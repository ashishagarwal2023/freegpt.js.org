# With Angular

This lesson is for installing FreeGPT.js for your Angular project.

## Create Project

Begin by creating your angular project (skip if already created or you want to add to your project). Then, move to your project and start development server.

```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli # Only once, to make Angular projects

$ ng new my-app
$ cd my-app
$ ng serve --open
```

You wil be asked some questions while creating the project, choose what you need.
